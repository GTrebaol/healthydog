# healthydog

This app is a personal app that I'll use to manage several things for my dog, I'll push it on the app store when it's done
It will serve me as a mean to make myself better at developing Kotlin apps with all the new frameworks and tools (databinding, koin, coroutines...)

Feel free to use the code however you want to, to ask questions, to suggest enhancements and so on

My goal is to use the app for the following :

- vaccination schedule with push
- BARF food intake with changeable formulas
- fetch close vet phone numbers 
- dog's weight and height curves from manually entered values
